Carbon Emission Prediction using ML 

A machine learning project to predict **carbon emissions** from server energy usage data. Built using Linear Regression and Decision Tree models, the goal is to identify key energy factors that influence emissions and evaluate model performance.

 # Overview
- Preprocessed real-world-style energy dataset (255 entries)
- Trained and compared two regression models
- Visualized predictions and top feature importance

# Models Used
- Linear Regression (Final model)
- Decision Tree Regressor

# Results
- **Best RÂ² Score:** ~0.71 (Linear Regression)
- Visualizations: Line graph (actual vs predicted), Bar chart (top features)

# Future Work
- Train on larger datasets
- Try ensemble models like Random Forest
- Deploy for real-time emission monitoring
